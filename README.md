# CankayaUniversityDoorLockSystemWithWiFi

  This project is made to enhance Çankaya University Technology Transfer Office Incubation Center's old door lock system.
  This is the next generation of the DoorLockSystemWithRFID, which has been enhanced with WiFi support to perform more advanced tasks.
  Previous system: https://github.com/barkinsarikartal/DoorLockSystemWithRFID

  This code executes the following statements:
  1) Get valid RFID cards from API,
  2) Read RFID cards by RC522,
  3) Trigger an electronic door lock if card ID is valid,
  4) Post data of the read RFID card IDs and the times they were read by the RC522.

  This code accounts for 1002625 bytes (76%) of program storage space, 48008 bytes (14%) of dynamic memory.
